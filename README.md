## Simple Grep CLI Application in Rust

This repo contains a small grep CLI app which takes query and filename as parameters and search for the query in the text file from the command line. It can also read the environment variable ```CASE_INSENSITIVE``` to make the search case-insensitive. This project follows the instructions in Ch.12 of the Rust Lang Book.
